I created a workday scheduler app for me to plan my daily importent events so i can manage my time effectively.
When I open the app, it displays current day on top of the calendar and when i scroll down i can see the time blocks for standard business hours.
When i view the time blocks for that day its color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present,or future.
When i click into a time block i can enter and event and save the event for that time block.
Text for that event is saved in local storage, when I refresh the page, the saved events persist.
